//
// The last thing that runs before a string is written somewhere a person can
// read it.
//
// Two properties matter more than regex quality, and both are asserted in
// redact.test.mjs rather than argued for here:
//
//   1. IT IS PURE. No filesystem, no clock, no randomness. A redactor that can
//      write is a redactor that can be the wrong layer to call last, and the
//      wrong layer to call last looks exactly like the right one in a log.
//   2. IT IS IDEMPOTENT. Placeholders are the one token in the output that no
//      pattern is allowed to match again, so a second pass is a no-op. That
//      matters because a report gets rendered, then summarised, then diffed,
//      and each of those steps may re-run this one.
//
// Ordering is part of the contract, not an accident of how the array is
// written. PATTERNS is applied in order, each pattern receiving the STRING THE
// PREVIOUS ONE PRODUCED, not the original. A single fused pass would let a
// broad pattern swallow a narrow one and lose the narrow one's count; feeding
// results forward means every pattern gets to say what it saw. The visible
// consequence is that `token=ghp_...` reports both github-token and
// generic-secret-assignment, with the wider pattern owning the final text.
//
// The 2FA pattern is deliberately label-anchored. A bare six-digit number is
// row counts, ports, build durations and postcodes; only a number sitting next
// to a word that means "I am a second factor" is a secret.

/** The single placeholder shape. Stable so that output stays greppable. */
