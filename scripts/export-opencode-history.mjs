//
// The exporter. Everything before this file is a library; this is the part a
// person types.
//
//   bun scripts/export-opencode-history.mjs --dry-run --limit 1
//
// WHAT IT OWNS, AND WHY IT IS THE SMALLEST FILE IN THE PLAN
//
// `opencode-db.mjs` reads rows, `render-session.mjs` turns a session into a
// note, `note-name.mjs` names it, `extract-attachments.mjs` unpacks its images,
// `sync-writer.mjs` decides whether the bytes on disk need to move. Every one of
// those owns a decision that is hard to get right, and none of them owns the
// only decision that cannot be delegated: what happens when one of 1023 sessions
// goes wrong.
//
// FOUR THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT
//
//   1. THE VAULT PATH CONTAINS A SPACE. `/home/belajarcarabelajar/Dokumen/
//      Obsidian Vault`. A value is taken as ONE argv element, never as a
//      fragment of a line someone split, and every path is built with
//      `node:path`. `--vault=PATH` and `--vault PATH` both work; nothing here
//      ever does `argv.join(' ')` and hopes.
//
//   2. A SINGLE BAD SESSION IS SKIPPED, AND A MOSTLY-BROKEN RUN IS NOT. 1023
//      sessions is a long enough loop that one corrupt row will happen. Skipping
//      it and reporting it is right; continuing after 700 failures and reporting
//      "exported 323 notes" is not — that is a partial mirror presented as a
//      complete one, and it is worse than no export because the summary looks
//      like a success. So the writes are BUFFERED: nothing reaches the vault
//      until the run knows how much of it worked, and more than half failing
//      exits non-zero having written nothing.
//
//   3. THE ATTACHMENT FILES ARE NOT MINE. `extract-attachments.mjs` writes
//      them with `writeFileSync` on a path derived from a content hash, so a
//      re-run over an unchanged database rewrites them with identical bytes.
//      Identical bytes with a fresh mtime is still a dirty file to `git status`,
//      and this vault has `obsidian-git` pushing on a timer. `snapshotAttachments`
//      + `restoreUnchangedAttachmentTimes` bring those files under the same rule
//      `sync-writer.mjs` applies to notes: content decided, not dates.
//
//   4. READ-ONLY, ALWAYS. The database is opened through `openReadonly()`
//      (`readonly: true, create: false`), and no query in this file names the
//      `credential` table. There is no code path here that can open it for
//      writing: `openReadonly` is the only way this file reaches a Database.
//
// Revert: delete this file and scripts/export-opencode-history.test.mjs. No
// library module imports it, so nothing else in scripts/ changes.
