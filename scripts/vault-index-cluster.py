"""vault-index cluster — T10: communities over the merged vault graph.

THE PROBLEM THIS SCRIPT EXISTS FOR.

T10 asks for `graphify cluster-only` in the vault. Measured 2026-10-03 against
the real merged graph, that command REFUSES to write, and the reason is not a
formality. `cluster-only` loads the graph through `graphify.build.build_from_json`,
whose ghost-merge pass collapses nodes on the pair `(source_file, label)` WITHOUT
regard to `file_type`. This graph legitimately carries, for the same file and the
same label, an old `document`/`heading` node AND a new `concept` node — 1,794 of
them (28% of all concept nodes). `build_from_json` keeps the heading and drops the
concept, so it reads 18,420 nodes where the file holds 20,214, and its overwrite
guard (export.py:315) then refuses to replace a 20,214-node file with a 18,420-node
one. Forcing it would delete 1,794 concept nodes from the only copy of the graph.

So the Leiden pass is still graphify's own — `graphify.cluster.cluster()` and
`graphify.cluster.label_communities_by_hub()` are the exact functions `cluster-only`
calls (cli.py:2105, cli.py:2247) — but the graph is built directly from the JSON
instead of through the lossy loader. Every node and link is preserved; only
`community` and `community_name` are added.

WHY THE DEFAULTS ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

`cluster(G)` is called with no arguments, which is `resolution=1.0` and
`exclude_hubs_percentile=None`. T10 step 2 is explicit that `--resolution` must not
be passed: measured on a copy of the real graph at 0.2, 0.5 and 2.0, the singleton
count stayed at exactly 1,415 every time, because a node with no incident edge has
nothing to cluster with. The parameter cannot move an isolated node, so it is not
passed. `exclude_hubs_percentile` is left at its default for the same reason the
plan does not mention it.

Usage:
    python3 vault-index-cluster.py GRAPH.json        # mapping JSON on stdout

The output is a single JSON object on stdout. Anything graphify prints goes to
stderr, so stdout stays parseable. The mapping is keyed by node id and carries the
community id and the hub-based name; a node that clustering left out (an isolated
node that Leiden did not assign) is reported in `unassigned` rather than invented.
