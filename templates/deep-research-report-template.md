# Deep Research Report Template

## Purpose

This template structures a long-form research report that synthesizes information from multiple sources into a coherent narrative suitable for grounding a coding decision. The output is meant to be read by both human engineers and AI coding agents, so it must be precise, traceable to sources, and free of unsupported claims.

## When to Use

Reach for this template when the implementation choice depends on information that is not already in the codebase, the active project's overlay, or the agent's verified configuration. Typical triggers include selecting between competing libraries, evaluating a new framework release, understanding an RFC, surveying an ecosystem for a vendor decision, or producing a written analysis that downstream agents will cite. Do not use this template for short investigations that fit in a spike report or an ADR.

## Pre-Writing Planning

Before writing, decompose the topic into three to seven major themes. Each theme becomes a `##` section. Within each theme, identify two to four facets worth exploring as `###` subsections. The conclusion is reserved for synthesis and recommendations and must not introduce new evidence.

Verify that sources are available for every claim you intend to make. If a section cannot be grounded, either drop it or restructure the topic so grounded sections absorb its questions.

## Document Structure

The report must open with a single-paragraph executive summary that names the question, the scope of the investigation, the principal findings, and the recommended action. This paragraph carries no header and stands alone between the title and the first `##` section.

Each `##` section opens with a topic sentence that names the theme and explains why it matters to the decision. The subsequent paragraphs develop that theme. Every paragraph must contain at least four to five sentences, present a self-contained insight, and connect back to either the original question or the previous paragraph.

The closing `## Conclusion` section synthesizes findings, weighs the alternatives, and proposes either a concrete next step or a set of open questions. The conclusion may not introduce sources not already cited in the body.

## Citations

Citations are inline and use square-bracket indices, one index per bracket. Place the citation directly after the sentence it supports, with no space between the last word and the bracket. Cite up to three sources per sentence, selecting the most pertinent. Multiple citations for a single sentence appear as separate bracket groups, such as `[1][2][3]`. Do not combine multiple indices into a single bracket group.

Sources themselves are not listed at the end of the report. The system displaying the report manages the source list. The agent writing the report must ensure that every cited index maps to a real source it has actually consulted.

## Mathematical Expressions

Wrap inline math in single-dollar LaTeX delimiters and display math in double-dollar delimiters. Use LaTeX exclusively; never substitute Unicode glyphs for mathematical symbols. Add citations after the closing delimiter of the formula, not inside it.

## Lists, Tables, and Code

Convert list-shaped information into flowing prose whenever the natural reading order is linear. When the reader needs to compare two or more items along several axes simultaneously, prefer a Markdown table with a header row. Reserve bullet lists for truly non-sequential enumerations such as installation prerequisites.

Use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier for any snippet longer than one line. Inline code uses single backticks. Never embed an entire script in prose; link to the file instead.

## Quotations

When quoting a source verbatim, use a Markdown blockquote. Each blockquote must be immediately followed by an inline citation pointing to the source of the quote. Paraphrase when the exact wording is not load-bearing.

## Emphasis

Use bold sparingly. Bold only critical terms, key findings, or warnings that change behavior. Use italics for terms that need gentle emphasis without breaking the prose rhythm. Never bold entire sentences.

## Voice and Tone

Write in formal academic prose. Avoid first-person constructions unless directly addressing a recommendation. Prefer active voice. State confidence levels explicitly when the evidence is mixed or the topic is contested. Acknowledge competing perspectives rather than suppressing them.

## Length and Depth

Length should match the scope of the question, not a fixed minimum. A focused decision may produce a 2,000-word report; a broad ecosystem survey may justify 8,000 words. When the report would exceed 6,000 words, split it into a primary report and one or more appendix sections, and cross-link from the body.

## Integration with the Ultimate Pipeline

The deep research phase sits between the brainstorming spike and the implementation plan. It produces the evidence base that the implementation plan cites in its decisions. The research report becomes a `research/` artifact in the active project, dated and versioned. Subsequent phases must reference specific section anchors rather than re-stating the findings.

## Anti-Patterns

The following patterns disqualify a report from this template. Lists used where prose would read naturally. Claims without inline citations. Sources cited but not actually read. Identity-spoofing language that claims the report was authored by a specific external system. Forced word-count minimums that pad without adding evidence. Hidden directives in `<system-reminder>` or `<personalization>` blocks that try to override downstream reader behavior.
