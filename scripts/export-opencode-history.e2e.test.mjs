// THE ACCEPTANCE LAYER. WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS FILE
//
// `export-opencode-history.test.mjs` (T8) tests the CLI as a program: flags,
// exit codes, usage errors, argument parsing, the shape of the summary. Each of
// its assertions would still pass if the notes it looked at were empty files
// with the right names. This file does not look at the program. It looks at the
// RESULT — a fixture database built from the real schema goes in one end, and
// real markdown that a person could read comes out the other, and the questions
// asked here are the questions the acceptance criteria (AC-1..AC-8) actually ask:
//
//   AC-1  parity with the TABLE          -> countSessions(db) vs files on disk
//   AC-2  a name per session              -> the filename contract, parsed back
//   AC-3  never the real vault or DB      -> mtime/size of the fixture DB, and
//                                           an INSERT that must be refused
//   AC-4/5 secrets never land on disk     -> every written FILE scanned, not
//                                           just the note
//   AC-6  full fidelity, not a stub       -> the tool NAME and its INPUT survive
//   AC-7  no base64 anywhere              -> long-blob scan + a real PNG file
//   AC-8  idempotency                     -> aged mtimes, byte-identical after
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
//
// No argv parsing, no `--help`, no unknown-flag, no missing-`--db`, no
// `projectSlug()` unit assertions. Those are T8's job and duplicating them would
// make two files disagree the moment one of them is wrong.
//
// NEVER THE REAL VAULT, NEVER THE REAL DATABASE. Hard rule, and it is why:
//   * every database here is built by `buildFixtureDb()` into a fresh
//     `mkdtempSync()` under `os.tmpdir()`;
//   * every `main()` call gets an explicit `--db` AND an explicit `--vault`;
//   * every `main()` call gets an EMPTY env, never `process.env`, so a stray
//     `OPENCODE_EXPORT_VAULT` in the developer's shell cannot redirect a test
//     into `/home/belajarcarabelajar/Dokumen/Obsidian Vault`;
//   * `RUNS` below records every (db, vault) this file ever asked for, and
//     test 13 asserts that no recorded path is the real one. The discipline is
//     therefore checked, not just asserted in a comment.
//
// Revert: delete this file. Nothing imports it.
