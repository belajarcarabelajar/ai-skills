// scripts/vault-index.mjs
//
// Works out which notes in the Obsidian vault have never been through
// extraction, so that the rebuild can fan subagents out over the difference
// instead of over the whole corpus.
//
// The single decision this module refuses to make for itself is WHICH FILES
// COUNT. The vault's `.graphifyignore` excludes `Satset/`, a directory of
// several hundred files of secret material, and that exclusion is a deliberate
// privacy boundary set by a person who understood what is in there. So
// eligibility is not decided here. It is delegated to graphify's own detector,
// which is the only implementation of these rules that has been exercised
// against that boundary. Writing a gitignore matcher here would be a second
// implementation of a security control, and the failure mode of the second one
// is not a stack trace — it is a clean-looking worklist containing one filename
// that should never have left the machine. Every line of that argument is
// worth more than the ten lines of matching code it replaces.
//
// The second reason to delegate rather than reimplement: graphify's rules are
// not the ones you would guess. Measured against the real vault on 2026-10-02,
// `detect()` applied 8 ignore patterns, pruned a `Legacy/` subtree, and also
// picked up two `AGENTS.md.bak-*` files. A hand-rolled matcher that reproduced
// the obvious part of the syntax would still miss all of that.
//
// Three properties of the wrapper are load-bearing, and each exists because the
// alternative reads as success:
//
//   1. THE ROOT IS A Path, NOT A STRING. `detect()` opens with `root.resolve()`,
//      which str does not have. Passing a string dies with an AttributeError
//      (measured, not assumed). PYTHON_SNIPPET is exported so that this is
//      checkable by reading the snippet rather than by trusting this comment.
//
//   2. A MISSING ROOT THROWS. `detect()` on a non-existent directory does NOT
//      raise: it warns on stderr, returns `total_files: 0`, and exits 0
//      (measured). Forwarded faithfully, that is a worklist of zero files,
//      which is indistinguishable from "the vault is fully indexed" — the one
//      report this module exists to produce and the one report nobody can act
//      on. So the existence check happens in JavaScript, before the boundary is
//      crossed, and a non-zero exit is raised with its stderr attached rather
//      than being parsed optimistically.
//
//   3. A PYTHON FAILURE IS NAMED. Any error from the subprocess becomes a
//      `vault-index:` error carrying `.stderr` and `.exitCode`. An empty
//      eligible list is a legitimate answer — a repo whose notes are all
//      ignored really does have none — so it must be distinguishable from a
//      detector that crashed, and only the exit code tells them apart.
//
// Paths are relativised against the resolved root on the way out, always, and a
// path that cannot be relativised raises rather than being returned as-is. An
// absolute path escaping this module would end up as a worklist entry naming
// `/home/<user>/...`, which is both machine-specific (so the worklist does not
// reproduce) and a mild disclosure of the directory layout. The manifest is
// already repo-relative by construction — graphify writes it that way when
// given a root (#777) — so the two sides of the subtraction agree by design
// rather than by luck.
//
// Sorting is unconditional. This output is the input to a fan-out across
// parallel subagents; an unsorted list makes the same work look different on
// every run, and a diff of two worklists is the cheapest possible check that
// the rebuild is not going sideways.
