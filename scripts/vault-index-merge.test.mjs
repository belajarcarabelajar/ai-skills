//
// Guards for the join that turns N independent subagent outputs into one
// graph.json, and — the reason this file exists at all — for the two numbers
// that are the only evidence the join worked.
//
// Measured against the real vault graph on 2026-10-02: 6,155 nodes, 5,527
// links, 416 hyperedges, and 1,415 nodes that are not the source or target of
// any single edge. The obvious reading of that last figure is "dangling
// endpoints", and it is wrong. Re-checking the same file by hand: 1,415 nodes
// have zero incident edges AND 0 of the 10,854 endpoint references in the link
// array fail to resolve. The graph is internally consistent. It is a forest of
// disconnected pairs, not a graph with holes in it. Which is why this module
// reports `crossChunkDangling` as its own counter rather than deriving a claim
// about orphans from it — a dangling endpoint and an unreferenced node are
// different defects with different fixes, and a report that conflates them
// sends the next person to the wrong file.
//
// The substantive behaviour is cross-chunk resolution, and it is the one thing
// about a parallel extraction that cannot be tested per-subagent. A subagent
// reading batch A sees a wiki link to a note that lives in batch B. That note
// is not in A's node list, is not in A's context window, and may not be
// assigned an id until B's subagent has already finished. Judged in isolation,
// A's link is unresolvable — so the link is either dropped, and the
// relationship between the two notes vanishes from the rebuild forever, or it
// is written, and the graph acquires 1,415 orphans. Neither is a bug that
// anybody notices at the time. The fix is a second pass over the union of all
// ids, after every chunk is in hand, and the tests below are built around the
// fact that that pass is what makes the graph a graph.
//
// Three decisions are pinned here rather than argued in prose, because all
// three are the kind that survive review and then quietly do the wrong thing
// at 6,000 nodes:
//
//   1. A REJECTED CHUNK IS REJECTED WHOLE. Not "merged until the bad link",
//      not "the nodes are fine so keep those". Partial acceptance is how one
//      confused subagent shrinks the graph, because a half-chunk produces a
//      plausible node count and nobody goes back to reconcile it. Rejection
//      is counted, and the offending chunk is NAMED, because "2 of 40 chunks
//      rejected" is unactionable and "batch-17.json was rejected" is a
//      resubmit.
//
//   2. A NODE-ID COLLISION AND A DUPLICATE LINK ARE DIFFERENT COUNTS, AND
//      NEITHER IS A DISAGREEMENT. Two chunks declaring the same node id is one
//      node plus one collision. Two chunks emitting the same
//      `source|target|relation` is one edge plus one duplicate — even when
//      they disagree about `confidence`, because a disagreement is a fact
//      about the extractors, not a second edge. The disagreement is counted
//      separately (`confidenceDisagreements`) so that dropping the second edge
//      does not also drop the information that the extractors did not agree.
//
//   3. `confidence_score` AND `weight` ARE NEVER DERIVED. It is tempting to
//      map EXTRACTED->1.0, INFERRED->0.75, AMBIGUOUS->0.5 and be done with it.
//      The measured file refuses: its EXTRACTED links carry both 1.0 and 0.9,
//      and its AMBIGUOUS links carry both 0.5 and 1.0. Those fields are the
//      output of a scoring pass that runs after this one, and a value invented
//      here would be indistinguishable from a real one in every downstream
//      read. The same rule applies to `built_at_commit`: threaded through or
//      null, never invented.
//
// Fixtures are synthetic and built in memory. A merge test that reaches into
// the real vault passes on this machine and fails on the next one, and the
// counts it would assert are exactly the counts that are allowed to drift.
