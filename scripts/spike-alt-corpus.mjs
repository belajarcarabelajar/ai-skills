// T1 — can a corpus of design-alternative pairs be built at all?
//
// THE ADMISSION TEST, STATED BEFORE THIS FILE EXISTED
//
// A harvested pair is admitted only when both texts come from the same
// alternative set in a real plan file, and a human-readable adjudication of
// `near-duplicate` or `distinct` is recorded per row. A row built by rewriting,
// paraphrasing, truncating, or synthesising an alternative is marked
// `synthetic: true`, counted separately, and EXCLUDED from the probe's score.
//
// That exclusion is the whole point, and it is here because of what happened to
// version 1 of the parent spike: a 77-row corpus with 96.1% of rows in one
// class passed its own size precondition and measured nothing. The obvious way
// to manufacture near-duplicate pairs is to restate an existing alternative --
// "add words to SENSITIVE_PATTERNS" becomes "extend the SENSITIVE_PATTERNS
// list" -- and every such pair is trivially separable by string overlap. A
// 6-line cosine baseline scores 1.00 on them. Measuring Jev on rows like that
// reports that a 273 ms network call beats arithmetic.
//
// WHY THIS REFUSES RATHER THAN REPORTS
//
// `classBalance` marks the corpus degenerate when the `near-duplicate` class is
// empty, and the CLI then exits 1 without writing the scored file. A corpus
// whose minority class is empty cannot measure calibration -- every bin would
// have a constant outcome and any ECE would be reporting the class prior -- and
// its agreement number is unfalsifiable, because a model answering `distinct`
// to every row scores 1.00. That number is indistinguishable from a good model
// unless you know the class counts, which is why the counts are printed on the
// way out and the file is not written at all.
//
// This mirrors `spike-skipif-corpus.mjs:137`, which fails closed with
// `E_PRECOND_IMBALANCE` for exactly the same reason.
