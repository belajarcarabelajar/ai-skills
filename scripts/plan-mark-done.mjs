//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// A plan is executed by an agent, and every step of it is a `- [ ]` line that
// nobody ticks. The runner knows which tasks passed, and it prints that — but it
// prints it to stdout and then exits, so the record of "T1 passed" lives in a
// scrollback buffer and nowhere else. Three sessions later the plan still reads
// as if nothing was done, the Obsidian mirror says `Draft`, and the only honest
// way to close the plan is to retype what the log already said.
//
// This command is the step that applies those ticks. It reads the runner's own
// status lines, decides which tasks reached a terminal success, and rewrites the
// single `[ ]` token on the step lines of exactly those tasks.
//
// WHY THE EVIDENCE, AND NOT A FLAG
//
// `--task T1` with nothing behind it is a way to type a checkbox, and a checkbox
// you can type is not a record of anything: it would be set the same way whether
// the work happened or not. So the default input is EVIDENCE — a runner log from
// `--from <file>` or stdin — and a task is ticked from it only when the log
// records a terminal success. `--task` remains available for an agent that ran
// the steps itself, and the output says `asserted, no evidence` on every such
// line, because the difference between "there is a log that says so" and "the
// operator said so" is the whole point of this command and must stay visible in
// the output rather than in the design notes.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS SUCCESS, AND WHY ONLY TWO THINGS DO
//
// The runner prints five terminal statuses (ultra-plan-runner.mjs, lines
// 365-403). Exactly two mean the work is done:
//
//   `T1: PASSED`                       every step command exited as expected
//   `T1: SKIPPED-IDEMPOTENT (...)`     skip_if exited 0, so the work was already
//                                      done and this run changed nothing
//
// The other three are NOT success and are refused, each for a different reason:
//
//   `NEEDS-AGENT`   the runner had no `run[]` to execute and handed the task
//                   back to an agent. Nobody verified anything.
//   `READY (dry-run)` nothing was executed. A dry run is a planning tool; letting
//                   it tick boxes would make `--help` output close a plan.
//   `HALTED-UPSTREAM` a dependency failed, so this task never ran. Its steps are
//                   untouched by definition.
//
// An unrecognised status is also not success. The rule is one-directional on
// purpose: a log that records something this build has never heard of is
// evidence of nothing, and treating an unknown token as a pass would make every
// future change to the runner silently permissive.
//
// WHICH LINES COUNT AS STEPS
//
// A line is a step only if it is a LIST ITEM whose first content is a checkbox:
// `^indent[-*+] spaces [[] x]` and the `]` is followed by end-of-line or a space.
// Four things are deliberately excluded, and each exclusion has been observed as
// a real hazard in the plan corpus rather than imagined:
//
//   - a `- [ ]` inside a fenced code block. The plans put command lines in
//     fences, and a fence that shows a checklist is an example, not work.
//   - a `- [ ]` inside a prose sentence. The anchor is the start of the line
//     (after indent), not the presence of the token, so "remember to tick - [ ]
//     this" is not a step.
//   - a `- [ ]` outside every `### Task <id>` section. Section 7 and section 8 of
//     a plan are full of unticked boxes that belong to no task and are not
//     closed by any task's completion.
//   - an ALREADY-TICKED line, in either case. Ticking rewrites one character; it
//     never normalises `[X]` to `[x]`, because that is a second edit nobody asked
//     for and a diff nobody reviewed.
//
// The replacement is byte-minimal by construction: the matched prefix, an `x`,
// the matched `]`, and the original remainder of the line. Every other byte,
// including CRLF endings, is the string it was.
//
// WHICH ID IS TRUSTED
//
// The frontmatter `tasks[].id` list, and nothing else. That is the plan's own
// machine-checked contract — it is what `topoSort` builds the DAG from and what
// the runner reports against — so a `### Task T9` heading with no frontmatter
// entry describes a task the runner never ran and can therefore never have
// produced evidence about. Refusing here is also the fail-closed direction: a
// looser rule would still refuse the id-nobody-declared case, and would refuse
// nothing extra. (`schema: ultra-plan/v1` is deliberately NOT enforced: this
// command edits text, the runner owns the schema contract, and refusing on a
// schema string would block a plan the runner rejects with a better message.)
//
// FAIL CLOSED, BEFORE ANY WRITE
//
// Every id in the log is checked against the frontmatter list BEFORE a single
// byte is written. A log that mentions a task this plan does not have is not
// about this plan — it is truncated output from another run, or a plan merged
// into another plan — and the safe reading of a record that does not match the
// document is to write nothing at all, including for the ids that DO match.
// Ticking T1 because a mixed-up log said T1 passed is how a plan ends up with a
// ticked box above a red step.
//
// Exit codes: 0 every task considered was ticked or was already ticked ·
// 1 an unknown id, a log that does not match the plan, or any task the evidence
// did not close · 2 usage error.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//
//   - It does not touch the Obsidian mirror. A mirror is derived state, and it is
//     overwritten on every publish, so ticking it here would be a write that the
//     next publish undoes. The ticks belong in the SOURCE plan; publishing after
//     is a separate, visible step.
//   - It does not run the runner, and it does not shell out to anything. It reads
//     text and writes text.
//   - It does not set `status:` in the frontmatter, does not publish, does not
//     `git add`, and does not commit. Closing a plan and recording that it is
//     closed are different acts, and this command does only the first one.
//   - It has no `--all` and no `--dry-run`. `--all` would be a bulk write across
//     every plan in the registry from one flag, and a dry run that needs a second
//     command to actually work is a mode nobody uses. Check what it would do by
//     reading the plan or by running it against a copy.
//
// HOW TO REVERT IT
//
//   git checkout -- <plan.md>
//
// The only mutation is one character per line: a space inside a `[ ]` on a line
// under one `### Task <id>` heading. Nothing is deleted, so a revert loses
// nothing, and `git diff` shows the change in full.
