// scripts/lib/redaction-selftest.test.mjs
//
// THE EXECUTABLE FORM OF A DECISION SOMEONE MADE KNOWINGLY.
//
// ~300 MiB of tool output — including 29,447 `shell` calls whose output may
// contain tokens — is about to be written into a git-tracked Obsidian vault
// that a plugin auto-commits and auto-pushes to GitHub every ten minutes. So a
// file written here is a file published. Redaction is a best-effort net, not a
// guarantee (that is the accepted risk, Intent Lock A9), and "best-effort" is
// the kind of phrase that quietly becomes "no protection" the first time
// somebody adds a pattern and forgets the fixture.
//
// This file makes best-effort falsifiable in two directions:
//
//   FORWARD  — every pattern in PATTERNS has a planted synthetic secret here,
//              and that secret must be caught. A pattern nobody planted a
//              sample for FAILS the run (section 2). It is not skipped, because
//              a skipped untested pattern is exactly the silent gap this file
//              exists to close.
//   BACKWARD — the guard that says `credential` is off limits is itself proven
//              to work, by feeding the validator a deliberately broken table and
//              by scanning every module under scripts/lib/ for a query that
//              reaches that table (sections 3 and 4).
//
// EVERY SECRET IN HERE IS SYNTHETIC AND ASSEMBLED IN-CODE FROM VISIBLE
// FRAGMENTS, so a reader can see at a glance that no test run can print a real
// credential. Nothing in this file opens `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`
// and nothing reads the Obsidian vault; the real database is never touched,
// read-only or otherwise. `buildFixtureDb` from test-fixture-db.mjs exists for
// anything that genuinely needs a database, and this file does not.
//
// A note on what is NOT asserted: nothing here claims the patterns are good.
// A pattern that matches too little is invisible to every assertion in this
// file, because a sample the pattern fails to catch is indistinguishable from a
// sample that was never planted. That is the boundary of a self-test, and the
// reason section 2 fails loudly on a MISSING sample instead of tolerating one.
