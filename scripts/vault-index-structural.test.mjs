// C7 — the structural layer of the vault knowledge-graph rebuild, and the tests
// that hold it to the contract the other chunks are written against.
//
// What this file is defending is narrower than "the parser works". It is that
// every node this module emits can be pointed at on disk. The graph this rebuild
// replaces carries 1,299 nodes whose `source_file` is null or empty — measured
// on `graphify-out/graph.json` — and that number is the reason the rebuild
// exists. An extractor that emits one more unattributable node has not made the
// problem smaller; it has made the number on the next audit 1,300. So the
// assertions that matter most here are the boring-looking ones: every node has a
// non-empty repo-relative `source_file`, no `source_file` is absolute, none
// contains `..`, and the whole chunk survives `validateChunk` with zero dangling
// endpoints. Those four are the deliverable. The fence and duplicate-heading
// tests are about not corrupting the graph with nodes that are merely wrong
// rather than absent.
//
// The corpus shaped the design in five places that a description of the task
// would not have predicted, and each is pinned by a test below:
//
//   1. DUPLICATE HEADINGS ARE THE NORM, NOT THE EDGE CASE. `#### input` appears
//      112 times in one conversation transcript; `### tool · shell` 76 times in
//      the same file. Across the corpus 1,092 files repeat a heading title
//      within themselves, 197,643 times. A heading id of `docId + slug(title)`
//      therefore collides constantly, and the validator reports a duplicate id
//      as an error that REJECTS THE WHOLE CHUNK. The id carries the ancestor
//      chain plus an occurrence counter, and `duplicate headings in one file do
//      not collide` is the test that keeps that from regressing.
//
//   2. FENCE CLOSING IS LENGTH-AWARE, AND GETTING IT WRONG COSTS 35,364
//      HEADINGS. A ````-backtick fence opened with four backticks legitimately
//      contains three-backtick lines; the vault's session transcripts do this to
//      embed prompts that themselves contain fences. Treating any backtick run
//      as a closer ends the fence early, and 217 files then parse differently —
//      measured, not estimated. The rule is the CommonMark one: same character,
//      at least as long, nothing else on the line.
//
//   3. 41% OF WIKILINK TARGETS DO NOT RESOLVE, AND MOST OF THEM ARE NOT NOTES.
//      Of 7,964 targets measured across the corpus, 3,806 resolve to a file and
//      3,294 resolve to nothing. Inspection shows the residue is largely bash
//      `[[ ... ]]` test syntax pasted out of transcripts plus links to PNG
//      attachments, not broken links between notes. That number is the reason
//      this module emits no placeholder nodes; see the `unresolved wikilink`
//      tests for the full argument.
//
//   4. BASENAMES ARE AMBIGUOUS IN 431 CASES. `quickstart.md` exists under more
//      than one directory, and 735 measured target occurrences hit such a stem.
//      Picking one arbitrarily would be fabricating an edge, so an ambiguous
//      stem is reported unresolved rather than guessed.
//
//   5. 92.9% OF ALL HEADINGS ARE SESSION-TRANSCRIPT SCAFFOLDING, AND EMITTING
//      THEM WOULD RE-CREATE THE FRAGMENTATION. 294,486 of 317,050, with
//      294,437 of those inside `05 - Conversations/`: `input` 59,385, `output`
//      59,410, `reasoning` 33,365, `tool · shell` 30,802, `assistant text`
//      15,002. A graph holding 59,385 nodes labelled `input` has no communities.
//      The filter is a title rule rather than a path rule so it works on a
//      transcript wherever it is filed, and the scaffolding tests pin the three
//      things that is easy to get wrong — that real sections under a filtered
//      heading are promoted rather than orphaned, that no surviving id moves, and
//      that `output format`, `user input` and `tools` are not collateral.
//
// Fixture convention: every test writes real files into a fresh temp directory.
// Nothing here reads the real vault. A test that depended on 4,138 files nobody
// controls would fail on a Tuesday for reasons unrelated to what it asserts, and
// the corpus measurements are recorded as numbers in the comments above instead
// — which is the property the audit trail actually needs, because the numbers
// can be re-measured and the fixtures cannot drift.

// titles in the corpus are `output` (59,410), `input` (59,385), `reasoning`

// the renderer rather than to the writer. Every tool call gets an `#### input`
// and an `#### output`.

// that it does not orphan the real sections nested under what it removed, that it

// is a lost node — and that it does not eat real headings whose titles merely
